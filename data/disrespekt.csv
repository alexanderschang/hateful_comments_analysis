I am still carrying a Firestar M45 from the 1990s.I totally agree with Chris on safeties and hammers and my thumb comes down on that safety and can rest on it like it's a natural part of the grip.  The M45 while heavy compared to polymer arms is incredibly easy to carry, much more so than a Block-19 which I also have, the latter with the latest and greatest plastic holster vs a basic Bianchi 6D.  Reholstering the Block scares me.  My USPs and the M45, with safety on, I don't worry so much.One thing about a steel gun you realize is that extra weight suddenly becomes a benefit when firing +P rounds from a 3.8"" barreled compact.  I'm firmly in the energy matters camp which is why I marvel that people would carry less shootable platforms (.45) that in most popular rounds offer pretty much the same energy as an equivalent 9 in the short 3.5"" barrels.  You add weight and decrease control for a gain of nothing.Gotta give huge props to Chris for taking the time to put so many rounds through gel at realistic barrel lengths.  It has steered me toward platforms that can deliver compactness with 3.8""+ barrels to regain lost velocity as well as lighter +P in .45 like Underwood which can deliver the additional energy that 9mm cannot.  Also I'm seeing why .40 has been considered ideal for 20 years up until FBI (with all of their day to day experience in gunfights lol) told everyone that they were going with 9mm.I'd say to any shooter if you are not getting more energy out of your platform vs 9mm you are wasting the potential of the platform and should go with 9.

They did it by copying the performance profiles of rounds that were known via anecdotes to be effective (and which were validated by M&S).Go onto the ballistics gel test pages and look at how 125gr .357 JHP, 185gr +P golden saber, and 115gr +P Corbon ammo does.  These are all rounds which predate the hyper ammo rage and they all deliver ""ideal"" gel performance AND were the top of the heap as far as M&S rankings.There is no data whatsoever to validate 12-18"" of penetration in gel.  Nobody shot actual people and compared those rounds at those velocities to performance in gel.  Yet this performance profile is accepted as canon.  It was an operational definition of ""good"" because everybody and their mother knew .357 was effective as hell in gunfights.

Nobody has shown a pangolin with this virus, or a community of pangolins or humans that live in close contact with them that have been getting this virus repeatedly as the virus evolves its way into being a human virus.H5N1 and H7N9 are two avian flus that are in the process of evolving into human viruses; they jump into humans every year and kill dozens.

They ended up developing a chimeric SARS-Cov with human transmissibility by altering its spike proteins.  They used Gain of Function, which is basically superaugmented evolution.  The technique uses animal hosts where you infect, harvest, and reinfect the animal hosts in series in rapid succession.  Effectively this causes an explosion in viral evolution as the normal processes of infection are accelerated greatly, and the virulence is guaranteed because the technique involves using virus from one host to infect subsequent hosts.GoF was ""banned"" by NIH because in 2012 a team used it to create a H5N1 variant that targeted ACE2, prompting a multiyear debate on whether or not this was something that should be done as that virus has a mortality of 60% and would literally have wiped out half of the planet if it were to escape from a lab.  ACE2 is what Sars-Cov-2 targets and it's been identified as a key for easy human transmissibility combined with airborne contagiousness.Zhi was not the only researcher from WIV that was on Baric's team; there were two of them who were coauthors and some say one more who was not named on the paper published in 2015.  The other Wuhan lab coauthor is coincidentally the scientist who first isolated a SARS-like coronavirus that had ACE2 intermediation, in 2013 (published).WIV seemed to be coronavirus central; like this virus was their central focus and Zhi had a very prominent role there.  The odds that of all places in the world, a SARS comes out with spike protein variation (this is HOW it differs from existing Covs) right there of all places preponderates heavily just based on circumstantial evidence that this was a lab leak.This is like having Jack the Ripper staying in a hotel and you find a body in the morning with knife wounds in a hotel stairwell.  An investigative team looking for a probable cause would examine things just like this- who was a potential perpetrator who was nearby at the time.The whitewashing of this, or else utter ignorance of GoF and how it *does not mean* ""genetically engineered,"" is bordering on criminal and has been aided and abetted by Nature, which is or was a flagship scientific journal.EVERY time some supposed expert on virology says ""there is no evidence"" for a lab leak, remember this- there is presently NO EVIDENCE for a zoonotic origin either!  There is only conjecture involving animals like pangolins which aren't herded or husbanded like birds (avian flu zoonotic source) or pigs (swine flu zoonotic source) in high density and close contact with humans.

All that matters is penetration and the size of the hole and whether you hit a vital organ.The answer is obviously to ditch these expensive bullet designs and just lower the speed of basic FMJ rounds.  Once those are down to only 12-18"" of gel penetration, we don't need anything else. Denim?  Barriers?

They are animals with nearly identical relevant physiology to ours.  All of us are mammals, have hearts, lungs, livers, spines, etc.  The same amount of each and in relatively similar locations.Energy is a myth and so is stopping power.The people in bear country are ALL WRONG and Johann and the lab boys are right.  High powered rifles starting with 4s are not the right tool for grizzlies, they should focus on shot placement and low recoil for quicker followup shots (LOL).Sarcasm aside,the entirety of the hunting community knows how godawfully wrong all of this gelatin stuff is.  Penetration matters, but a freakin 9mm with FMJs is woefully inadequate against a bear despite very good penetration.  It's woefully inadequate against nearly any animal because it is UNDERpowered.  The same as way the gelatin 9mm fanboys cannot grasp that a .380 that penetrates gel just as much as a 124g +P 9mm round is not its equal (although they will never say we should all carry .380s, just don't carry a .45).ENERGY matters.  It is energy that drops things.  Penetration of vitals kills them *eventually* but rarely immediately.  Bow hunters know this.  Arrows seldomly drop animals but they frequently kill them.People who hunt know which caliber and which round for which game...despite zero gel tests of any of it.  All anecdotal, crowd-sourced info.  go figure.Handguns couldn't POSSIBLY have the same type of info behind them, the 70-year rep of .357 mag is just ""confirmation bias.""  LOL",0,,Hammer,1,?
246,Luckygunner Lounge,Feed Your Revolver: .38 Spl & .357 Mag Ballistics Gel Test Overview,[],48 comments,http://www.luckygunner.com/lounge/revolver-ammo-commentary/,disrespekt,"This gelatin cult is almost farcical.VSP has reported (check wiki on .357 Sig) that dogs are getting dropped in one shot by .357 whereas it was taking multiple hits from 9mm.Cape Buffalo cull- rigorous recording of whether animals dropped in place or ran then dropped.  All were dissected afterwards; animals dropped in place had hemorrhaging effects in the brain.Anyone who's hunted knows about the relative effectiveness against game in the size class of humans with respect to different pistol calibers, whether the animal drops, buckles then runs, or runs then beds down and dies.  You can watch gunshots buckle the legs of a buck before he runs then dies.  It's a brain effect.Energy has the ability to cause a flash knockout or remote pressure effect on the brain or CNS.  Dogs do not have psych stops; neither do bears or any other animal especially attacking predators.  Attacking dogs do not decide to comply because of the louder bang of the SIG vs 9mm.The entire development of .357mag vs 38spl was a result of *actual* subpar performance of the latter in the field.  Not gelatin.Go look at tnoutdoors do his gel test on .22 Velocitors. They meet the 12-18"" spec.  So we should all carry .22s, everywhere.  You can get them to penetrate really deeply too, .22s; many times they have complete pass through on 18"" or 24"" gel blocks.  So they should be effective against animals 2x the size of humans, right?Gelatin is precise but it IS NOT ACCURATE.  Fatal wounds are not the ONLY THING besides ""psychological stops"" that stop attackers.Anecdote story- woman in progress of being abducted off the street in high crime city pulls .25 from purse, shoots attacker in shoulder.  ""I'm going to kill you bitch"" comes out of his mouth.  Second shot to the chest, he hits the pavement.  Gets up, gets back into car, drives away.  She calls police, he's found at a nearby hospital.  What made him hit the pavement?  Not psychology and not the bang of the gun and not a fatal hit to a vital organ (your body can go a long time anaerobic, which is why deer are able to RUN AWAY even after having their heart shot to pieces).There are other physiological stopping mechanisms than psych or direct CNS hits.",0,,,1,?

If you studied the bolsheviks or maoists or the Khmer Rouge, you find that the intellectuals who championed the movements (and were indispensable to it) were among the first marched out and shot.The French Revolution was arguably of mordechaist sentiment and each and every one of the ""thought leaders"" throughout that grisly period, including Robespierre himself, were marched in turn to the guillotine.  Subsequent intellectuals who had philosophical disagreements about the character and goals of the revolution were themselves guillotined eventually.Lev Bronstein (trotsky) was pretty quickly taken out after the Bolshevik revolution led to total power.  The Rouge began with the ""rich"" and proceeded down the line of every inequality until they were killing people who wore eyeglasses or who could read.  Mordechaist revolutions never run out of people to kill because inequality can never be extinguished.  Consequently, they never produce prosperity.

I think he moved it all to the Gold members zone and then the fker started putting my verbiage in his tickers lolAnyhow, my thesis was that there was no limit to credit growth that could be driven by synthetic debt.  The only issue was the keystone effect of its tiny nexus to the real world, the default triggers.  Those were back on defaults of real mortgages.  They originated CDSs based on the same default triggers over and over again, thus exploding the credit base while at the same time driving massive, massive fees for themselves.But when the defaults started coming, the entire ponzi house of cards comes down.  Thus the Fed is directly monetizing or ""lenditizing"" the crap paper.  Our system is LENT money, not printed money...it makes no difference if the Fed ""lends"" to the banks to take their crap paper and even pays them to do it...our system requires credit growth.The problem with the synthetic debt is that it grew so much that it made a deflationary monetary trend inevitable.  It's made to get snuffed out very quickly with little to no recovery value.  That's what happens when you have synthetic debt, there's no real capital.To provide some definitional context, a CDS is like a bond in reverse, except with no capital.  It has a coupon payment that can be tranched.  AIG served as the ultimate idiot in the room, the final link in the daisy chain against whom everyone netted out.  So, basically the whole street all these years was getting paid to originate CDSs, take the payment streams therefrom, tranche them into CDOs, sell them off, extract fees, then find a counterparty to net the original exposure out to.  This is criminal.There was no insurable interest, needed to be no interest whatsoever on the part of the CDS writer.  An IB could write a CDS on my mortgage without even knowing who I am and then tranche its coupon and make money off this nonsense!These CDSs have been netting at .05-.07 in the few BKs we've had...that is a TON of ""latent"" or ""theoretical"" inverse bond capital that was not paid, destroying the leverage inherent in the instruments, and causing the deflation.",,,Bankrupt,0,0

Also, there are 1/10oz gold coins, and one thing that is neglected in the consideration is something that Ferfal speaks about - gold jewelry.  In Argentina, apparently, there are those who are trading a few links of a gold chain as they need to.For taking futures delivery, you need to be aware of the lot sizes that they trade.  Comex will give you either a 100oz bar or else 3 kilo bars of gold.  As for silver, the lot sizes are even higher.

All debts originate at the CB, the money the banks ""borrow"" to lend fractionally comes ultimately from the CB.  So, my proposal was that the Fed would merely forgive the debts, perfecting the latent inflation.  None of the TF cult foresaw moneyprinting, they claimed that it would be akin to suicide.  They thought that the Fed would let debtors rot with deflation...got news, the USG is the biggest debtor in the world.  Deflation would crush them.  If the Fed won't print, the USG will.  Simple as that.Needless to say, my prognostications proved accurate but he refused to unban me.  Once he saw Cantarell shed 34% production YoY, I think he wised up on oil at least.  But, he hates gold, thinks it's useless.  Well, hell, so are a lot of things people want.  The TF cult likes ""lead"" instead of gold, thinking that they can shoot their way to prosperity, I dunno.

There isn't the oil supply for the way things ran for the last 150 years to continue.  Commodities are peaking one by one.  We're at the end of an era here, the patterns of development and ""growth"" are obsolete.The world is functionally overpopulated as we speak...if world population continues to grow, we will actually achieve peak fresh water and peak food and have a big assed dieoff.Will the asians ever consume like us?  It's impossible for them to.  Look at the wikipedia ranking of per capita oil consumption by nation and see what type of supply rate we would require for this even to be feasible.  It's astoundingly beyond what the earth can produce.  We consume more than 30x what Indians consume and more than 10x what the Chinese do, per capita.  We consume 18mbpd, against a population of 300M...correct my math but Indian and Chinese consumption parity would alone require an additional 160mbpd of oil production.  This figure is itself roughly twice the peak production of the earth in 2006.  We'd need to find like 27 more Ghawars to make this reality.You're failing to recognize what caused the inflection of a 40 year growth bubble; it wasn't by accident.  Those who can't grasp that we have entered a new Age here are going to be in some trouble.One of the things I have tried to get people to understand here and on TF is that energy is a fundamental input to all economic activity.  We grew and grew until our ability to supply energy hit a ceiling in 2006, because all that growth was underpinned by steadily rising supplies of energy.Supposing we conduct a thought experiment of this 5-7% growth in asia...what are the more cars going to run on?  What will power more buildings?  What will power more factories making more things?  What will power more cranes to erect more structures?  What will melt more steel and fabricate more iPods and weld more cars?That is the fundamental problem here and why the market crashed when it did.  Energy is in a state of transition from an increasingly abundant commodity to an increasingly scarce one.  Sure, we can say oh we'll build nuclear plants.  Setting aside the EROI on those, what happens when we achieve peak Uranium?  Nobody who looks into the energy situation in any depth is not very frightened because the needed scale of construction of alternative power is staggeringly vast.  As oil production declines inexorably and irreversibly, remember we will not only need to replace lost BTUs but also to add more on top of that in order to achieve supply growth necessary for economic growth.  Take a look at France's energy situation...they are at nuclear saturation; research why their heat wave a few years back killed 3000 people, why they had to shut plants off, why they cannot build more plants.  Functionally, when we pass peak, we must effectively *double* our energy supply growth rate, first to make up for lost oil, second to supply growth needs.  This is physically impossible.  Nevermind that we ain't got the electric cars or electric planes or electric ships or electric trucks needed to expand the ""globalist"" trade and growth phenomenon.",,,jayinasia,0,0

They removed all control rods to prevent reaction collapse and when the system began powering back up, it moved so fast that they had no hope of throttling it.Oil consumption has fallen dramatically...watch for another oil price spike; that will kill whatever nascent recovery is appearing to form.  All this new debt reflects incredible amounts of future consumption pulled to the present and we require pretty extraordinary growth to even keep pace with debt growth, much less outstrip it.  The massive debt the government is taking is placing an ENORMOUS strain on the future.

Instead of fractional lending that creates inflation and deflation bubbles, money should be printed in line with real production such that its value remains constant.

No money exists in our system absent what is lent by a bank.  The overhang of the compounding interest exponential function forces exponential economic growth in order to maintain the system, otherwise interest begins to consume a larger and larger share of real production and the only way to pay interest is to create ever more production.It should be obvious that no system with finite constraints can grow forever.

We've known from scientists that this was coming worldwide at some point for over 50 years now.  And, we got conclusive confirmation of the theory in 1970...which is when the US economy came unhinged, Bretton Woods collapsed and we entered a decade of stagflation that was ended by the Raygunomics miracle of borrowing using the reserve currency as collateral.  The USSR was not so lucky; they achieved their peak in 1989 and collapsed very shortly thereafter.  All economic growth systems require growth in inputs, the most significant of which is energy.All the technological advancement of the past 39 years has not in any way reversed the US's peak.  Production declines relentlessly, even including the coming online of the N Slope in Alaska in the 1970s.  Technology cannot reverse production declines.  In fact, it may speed them.Technological advancement in extraction methods have made field production curves no longer resemble smooth bell curves, but rather trapezoidal shapes.  By employing 2ndary and tertiary extraction techniques from the outset, production can be brought up more rapidly at the cost of a steeper falloff after peak is achieved.  This maximizes the NPV of the well trading it for lifespan.Cantarell is a good example of this, as is the N Slope.  The BPT trust 10k forecast 7-9% YoY production declines...reality was 15+%.  Cantarell production crashed last year by 34%, vastly in excess of the optimistic models' predictions of single-digit decline rates.In fact, what technology did was get more oil out quicker and hasten the appearance of Peak.  Now, when production declines, the field is basically ""empty.""We've known these facts for nearly 40 years, yet nothing was done.  This may suggest that nothing can be done; there simply is no replacement for oil.  ",,,Hard_Rain,0,0

There's a reason why France cannot build more nuclear plants despite the need for them.Listen, anyone who tells you that a real-world system can continue growing forever is a fool.  Oil, too, is a finite resource, and at some point, production peaks and then declines.  It's happened already in 54/65 oil producing nations.  It happened in the US in 1970, in the USSR in 1989, in Mexico in 2004, in the UK in 2000...the list goes on.  Whether it is a well, a field, a nation, or the world, all resource extraction rates eventually peak and then decline.Lots of people may want to believe in the ""miracle"" of technology, but once a well peaks, nothing can reverse that.  This is a matter of geology and physics.  We have transitioned from the Age of Growth into an Age of Increasing Scarcity.  Betcha didn't know Helium production peaked in 2002?  Gold peaked around 2000...we are at a major inflection point here.  Oil is free energy, we need another type of that.  Not wind and solar which have immense manufacturing, infrastructure, construction, deployment, etc., costs attached to them.

This means that the market can pretty much be pushed in any direction so long as the ""mass"" of ownership stays put.Given the rise in unemployment and continued deterioration of ""main street"" economic indicators, along with the insolvency of major states such as CA, it's in the administration's vested interest to keep the stock market, the sort of headline economy indicator, up for as long as possible.I am looking to short individual names, weak banks such as ZION, STI, BAC, and GE, with an eye toward increasing deterioration in CRE portfolios.Medicare is operating this year at a $330B+ deficit, which has not been considered in the headline deficit number; it will in reality perhaps cross $2.5T.  This is a bond market dislocation waiting to happen.  Also the political will has been lost for additional deficit spending and bailouts, so it's unclear how the IOU situation in CA and certain cities like PHI, as well as very close in other states, will be dealt with absent massive cuts in payrolls and expenditures.  AIG is also again near bankruptcy as reinsurance deals they cut have impaired the ability to even sell AIG's ""profitable"" divisions, which are on the hook for perhaps another $200B in losses.

We may have just finished A down of the GS degree correction.  Hell, we could be only through A down of A down.These types of moves can unfold over the course of centuries, certainly, but the GD1 took 10 years.  We are at the very least in the midst of a move of that scale.  I argue that the GD1 was a very much more favorable situation because of the oil supply issue, it was a lower-degree correction.  This here, where we are at is near the END of a motive advance that has occurred since the Renaissance.  It's possible this is Wave 4 down of a 5 move advance over the course of 500 years and that we can bounce a little bit using wind and coal and burning up our uranium and thorium until we achieve peak conditions in those too, then wave 5 truncates and we must retrace the aggregate advance.

The Age of Empires was retraced over the course of the entire Dark Ages, with minor blips including the Ottomans, etc., representing B upwaves in the context of the larger decline.  The current Age of Growth advance we find ourselves in dates to the Renaissance, and the Industrial Revolution should be wave 3 of this advance or maybe wave 5.  Either way, it must retrace.  The GD represented a retracement within the context of the advance of the Industrial Age, but the latter occurred within the larger Age of Growth that was driven by increasing supply in hydrocarbon energy supply.Either way, we face a wave 4 down within the context of this move which should be on par with the period following the end of the Roman Empire, and should unfold until another growable energy supply is discovered, perhaps fusion power.  This could be 10, 20, 50, 100 years away.  Until then, there is no escaping the fact that aggregate energy supply will be declining.

We're about to find out how much oil supply matters and how there is no replacement for the growth in supply of a resource that was critical to our growth-based economic system.

675,evilspeculator,Fucking Friday Rub Down,[],205 comments,https://evilspeculator.com/fucking-friday-rub-down/,disrespekt,"This is not a crisis that could have been solved by regulation.It's a crisis of exponential growth credit-based monetary systems leeching off of a real economy that has peaked.It's a reason I say people shouldn't sweat not paying back banks who fractionally lent them capital that they never had.  Let the Fed eat it.Basically, money is not printed, it is lent into existence, at interest.  That places a concurrent demand on the economy to generate the output needed to pay back the principal (zero-growth state) along with a need to grow in order that the interest can be repaid.  Money denominates real things, and the compound interest component mandates growth in output, production, more things so that the interest can be repaid.  This is all well and good so long as the economy continues to grow.  However, when we achieved the peak supply condition in oil, it became clear to those who can use logic along with basic math that the economy's ability to continue to grow had stopped.  This is when you see deleveraging and the mass stampede out of debt.  The music simply stopped.If you distill our economy solely down to energy for transportation, a peak oil condition means that there will not be more consumption of oil next year because there won't be more oil supplied next year.  So, more drivers driving more miles in more cars (growth = more) will not be feasible.  The absolute real transactional volume of that economy peaks along with its energy inputs.Those who have debt and see that they CANNOT grow to meet their forward obligations have no choice but to deleverage, and if necessary, liquidate.The real economy peaked several years ago.  What we had was a synthetic economy based upon CDS-derived CDOs.  Notional GDP continued to grow as each transaction in synthetic debt represented nominal wealth creation.  But, it was fictional.  As the real economy peaked, its nexus to the synthetic economy began to cause cascading collapse in a system that required growth, that being the monetary system itself.  They had NO CHOICE but to do these apparently ""stupid"" things because there was NO option within the real economy past 2005 to generate real growth.  So, they moved money around in synthetic instruments and this notional transactional ""GDP"" was what serviced the growth needs of the monetary base.The Fed has no choice now but to print money because the real economy cannot service the interest levied upon it by the monetary system itself.  The debts CANNOT be repaid.  People do not know this, but our monetary system effectively collapsed in August 2007.  It had been Wile E. Coyote-ing since 2005 driven by exponential growth of synthetic debt.",,,Graphite,2,?

It's a big power club.  However, labor pricing power is what created the middle class in this country, instead of got us a larger version of Mexico or Brazil.  Labor banded together and formed its OWN corporation, and demanded concessions.It is no accident that CEOs through the heyday of labor unions were generally very REASONABLY paid and that corporations that paid dividends had to use free cash for THAT instead of stock buybacks to keep the options grants from diluting the common.  All that changed in the 80s and 90s, when we became a finance ponzi economy.  Cisco, for example, paid an entire DECADE's worth of profits just in exec comp.  A freakin decade.  Only the casino capital gains that the .com ponzi bubble provided confused stockholders into thinking they were getting a good deal.  Only a ponzi bubble can distract people from what is real.Unfortunately, I cannot agree that we need more democracy.  Democracy is a complete failure simply because the vote of a person who cannot even read the name of the person he is voting for counts the same as an informed voter.  This is a nightmare waiting to happen.We have 50% of the population paying no income taxes...they will not suffer from increased taxation that they can mob vote onto the other half.  Unfortunately, what we suffer from is nothing more than simple corruption.  The monied class has captured the Congress, the Presidency, and the Courts.  And they use media they own to pit the lower classes against the middle class.  Nowhere is there any anger against the REAL upper class, only against the visible working rich, people probably like us.  The trade class, engineers, doctors, etc., these are not the executive class, the political class by and large.  They work for their money.  And they are the ones who stand to be downwardly mobile.  The corrupt executive class has Congress dole out money to them, to buy their vote; they are IN on the corruption.  But at the same time, those who administer these giveaways themselves profit IMMENSELY.Government is ABSOLUTELY responsible for this mess, everywhere they trod, misallocation occurs.  In some cases, this can be beneficial, for example if they subsidized the construction of carbon fiber car parts, but in most cases, such as subsidizing debt, it is disastrous.But in every case, ask, cui bono?

Nope, just sustained global recession.One thing that irks me is how people hate the institutions of unions or any kind of labor pricing power.  The executives all sit on each other's boards, play golf with each other, and help each other's children get into Stanford and get junior executive jobs.  Their goal as executives is to vote themselves the most massive pay packages possible, pay ""retention"" bonuses for the ""critical"" talent that guided the company into bankruptcy, and to outsource every single other operation to the lowest labor cost center possible.  And, when that produces a short-term profit, to bonus themselves every single dollar of it.You are not going to get rich being a shareholder of this operation because they don't pay dividends; they pay themselves.  The UAW and its membership, corrupt as it is, are NOT the reason GM or Chrysler went BK - management is.  The same management that sits on the boards of all the financials and other companies and rubber stamps CEO corruption.  You see this played out in the outrage by AIG execs of all people, a BEYOND BK company, at the notion that they shouldn't receive 7 figure salaries working for a company that loses tens of billions per quarter.The US middle class is collapsing because of loss of labor pricing power and an entrenched executive class that functions on backscratching and nepotism.  You can't get ahead in Brazil or Mexico or China unless you were born into the right womb, and that dynastic wealth has one goal, to preserve itself.  Right now, the very rich are seeing NO hard times.  Where are the paycuts for bankers?  They fire all the rank-and-file and pay themselves retention bonuses to do it.  We live in a corruptocracy that very strongly reminds me of the situation in Brazil, for example.  There are two classes, rich and everybody else, and a sliver-thin group of people who are being dragged slighly upward by the global debt bubble.  That is where we are going.  The rich OWN the government.  The bigger it gets, the more money there is to divide amongst the lobbyists, the Congress, and the businesses that profit from policy.  Wonder why there are paid advertising spots now for national health care?  Think it's because someone cares JUST THAT MUCH?  Think again.  Somebody stands to profit.We should outsource executive jobs to lower cost Chinese and Indian incompetents.  They could BK any of these companies FAR more cheaply than our domestic executives.And, one theme that is popular on KD's website is that people have some moral obligation to repay debts.  No.  I have a moral obligation to repay a person, not a corporation, and certainly not a BANK, who NEVER actually had the money they lent me in the first place.  If I borrow from the Count, I should pay the Count back.  A bank?  Hell, they INVENTED the capital, lending, at fractional reserve, money they never even had!  What RIGHT do they have to TAKE my real property on account of interest levied on fictional money?  The banks have the privilege of earning interest on ""capital"" they never possessed.  A debt to a bank is a business transaction, not personal.  The fractional reserve system creates inflation by its very nature, and the banks and bankers get access to that money before it has diluted the monetary base stock.  They get inflation dollars at today's prices...we get them as they dilute.  And, then the bankers preserve their purchasing power by levying interest on this conjured money at rates beyond inflation.  And, they have the courts to help them seize REAL THINGS if this fictional capital is not repaid.The whole system is a fucking scam and needs to be torn down.  So many things people believe just aren't true.",,,Count_de_Monee,7,?

These channels are quite unlike most channels you will see; they almost could have been drawn with a ruler, almost computer-generated.  So, philosophically, we are waiting for a retest of the underside here, yes?  Each successive high saw diminishing momentum and the daily stochs are looking to plunge, having rolled over.Secondly, WRT to the SPX, we got ever so close to the 200dma, which everyone expected.  So, what are we looking for in terms of potential to hit that?  SPY got to a daily RSI of nearly 70, which is a classic sell point in a bull trend, with the corresponding buy to be at the 50dma.  We are clearly in no man's land sitting 60 below the 200 and 60 above the 50.  From a TA perspective, we should clearly sell here but find support on the 50ma, but that 200ma is so tantalizingly close.

746,evilspeculator,Hell Week Rub Down,[],158 comments,http://evilspeculator.com/hell-week-rub-down/,disrespekt,"Oil is loosely defined as Crude & Condensate.Liquids include unconventionals, biofuels, natural gas liquids, and other liquid energy equivalents.You can find the various productive curves at TOD.  Essentially, C&C peaked in 2005, but there were sufficient increases in biofues, NGL, and unconventionals, to make a higher total liquids peak in 2008 despite a decrease in C&C production.The problem with other liquids besides NGL is that they are of ridiculously lower EROI than C&C.  Original oil production had a 100:1 energy positivity ratio; we are now down to 3:1 and dropping.  Tarsands require massive consumption of energy to heat water to mobilize the bitumen.  So much so that Alberta was or is going to construct a nuclear plant to do it; right now they are burning tons of natural gas.  This swaps one form of energy for another, albeit at a positive EROI.The oil situation is not a matter of running out, it is a matter of diminishing return on investment.  When I explain peak to people, I try saying things like supply inflection or supply cannot increase, flow rate maximum...most don't get it.  EROI is a bit easier to explain; it's like an apple tree.  You go after the low-hanging fruit first; it has the highest energy positivity, because you don't have to climb for it.  The higher fruit you have to expend energy to go up and get, and so your return on energy invested gets lower.  And, oil wells, unlike apples, don't replace themselves in a year.  At some point, the energy from an apple equals the energy needed to climb to get it.  At this point, you are at breakeven and the rest of the tree higher up is inaccessible.  Even if it has infinity apples higher up it takes more energy to get them than you get back.  This is why things like theoretical reserves in shit like oil shale or other low-EROI sources, including tarsands are grossly misleading.The oil situation is about rate of supply, not reserves.  Canada ostensibly has 250B bbl in tarsands, equivalent to the reserves in Saudi Arabia.  The difference is that that 250B worth of bitumen will only flow, at best, 4-5mbpd and this means consumption of massive amounts of NG, a nuclear plant, and the pollution of nearly every fresh water source west of the rockies.  KSA on the other hand, flows 10-12mbpd from conventional sources.  This is a clear indication of diminishing EROI and why those who claim that there is a trillion bbl in shale are fools.  So what if there is?  Let's just make it a quadrillion barrels...so what?  We cannot get at them at a rate sufficient to support the rate at which we desire to consume them.  Peak oil is about rates, not reserves.",,,Guest,0,0
747,evilspeculator,Hell Week Rub Down,[],158 comments,http://evilspeculator.com/hell-week-rub-down/,disrespekt,"There are immense structural differences between 1930 and now.The single BIGGEST factor is the achievement of Peak Oil in 2005, then Peak Liquids in 2008.There is simply a hard ceiling on industrial output now that DID NOT exist in 1930.  Nevermind the entitlements obligations and all the rest of it; it is not possible to GROW out of this debt without massive increases in energy consumption and supply.The global recession will be sustained.  Watch the oil price.  If we see a fiscal policy-led rebound here we will see a concurrent increase in oil consumption which will AGAIN ram us into the supply constraint and oil will again spike to $150 as demand exceeds production and inventories are again drawn down to meet the deficit.  We will repeat this collapse cycle.  That is your Wave C of 4 down and it is inevitable.I cannot fathom that people can believe that exponential growth can simply meet a speedbump and then there just ""will be"" a recovery because of interest rate policies and increased debt.This is not 1930.  It is not 1973, it is not 1982.  How economists and cental bankers can fail to realize what the NECESSARY inputs are for economic activity and that the most critical input has reached supply rate inflection is beyond me.  Case in point, no amount of fucking moneyprinting, debt, strenuous wishing, or The Secret-inspired mass cognitive dissonance can make Cantarell produce more oil next year than last.

I've lowered my profit expectations on every position and I'm not playing heavy here.  You almost have to be happy with ekeing out .2, .3 here and there on the FAS/FAZ side and a buck or two on SRS, and trying to make minimizing losing trades your #1 priority.  This market sucks so bad I don't even want to watch it.  This strongly reminds me of last March/April, except for the lack of total VIX collapse this time.

Also, add in that the ISEE is showing a profound trend of long stock, short indices and this has been the case for some time.  I wonder, then, if what is occuring is that quants or program trades are shorting 2x and 3x inverse ETFs, primarily the major 2x inverses and the arb needs of the trade balance is causing the ballistic spike we've seen in names which are quite literally at the verge of bankruptcy.Add onto this that for every ISEE put opened on an index, the MM will typically establish a short position in that stock as a hedge for the trade.  If you buy puts on SRS, your MM should short the underlier to net his position, and this would seem to have a 2x effect on anything in the index, as far as Profunds having to set up some kind of double-long synthetic position.  Crammer has long maintained that SKF wags the financials sphere via its size and leverage.  I wonder if the unusual convergence of margin quant trading and the evaporation of liquidity and short availability of a lot of the indices implies that the very same thing is occurring now except in reverse.  The big players are using puts and inverse ETFs as well as margin buying on the underliers to drive literally the crappiest stocks to the moon.I cannot prove that this is what is happening; all I have is a theory that tends to fit the facts.  If this is actually happening, the unwind of all this will be...severe.  I may put a position on longer dated, far OTM SRS calls in expectation of a reversal of this at some point when the game exhausts itself.Comments?",,,,3,?

This ain't my evil twin ""respekt"" you talkin to  LOLI don't care much about the O'bamma administration, because they are a bunch of incompetents.What I do take issue with is the sloppiness in the Mises paper.  We have achieved peak oil and thus our energy supply has peaked.  This is a big freakin problem.  It's the largest problem that has faced man since the Toba eruption.I say, and I say again that a policy geared towards net exporter of energy and surplus trade is feasible given the natural resources the USA has.  However, we have a parasite called the financial system that is sick and it is demanding that we bail it out.  Our parasite is desperate to keep itself sucking our blood and so we are injuring ourselves to save it.The financial system is not responsible for wealth creation, production, or any sort of economic progress simply because there were, oh, 150 years of growth in the USA without any central bank or a debt-based monetary system.  We were the richest nation on earth prior to the Fed Act.  These are just the facts.There is no option to maintain the status quo because energy supply is falling and will continue to fall forever.  This is what Peak means.  We cannot depend upon forward growth which by its nature requires energy supply growth as an input.  So we must reorient ourselves to a different vision built around what we can do.Either we find a way to get fusion power or mine the solar winds and exotic stuff like this or else the industrial revolution is ended and man will decline irreversibly back to the coal then wood ages.  And this means a massive die-off and a lot of upheaval.  I'd like to avoid that if at all possible.",,,TomOfTheNorth,1,?

I used to do that on TF before KD banned me for arguing peak oil and inflation too much.Wind and solar are primary power sources.  We use PBMRs for backup power in a distributed fashion.  The sun does not shine at night, but power is less used at night.  This isn't a showstopper.We also have SIGNIFICANT existing coal and NG plant capacity IN CASE the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow.The reality is that the $12T would have been better-spent on renewable power sources.The economists have failed to realize that the credit peak was caused by peak fucking oil, or more accurately peak EROI.  Energy is what does the DOING, not credit and not fiat money.I did a back of envelope calculation with a friend and determined that at RETAIL prices we could put panels on everyone's roof in the fucking country for less than $1T.  The upper midwest by some estimates(in Time Mag) could provide 90+% of the country's electricity needs via wind alone.The solution here is SIMPLE. We INVEST using inflation or credit in ENERGY PRODUCTION (something that generates a return).  Our goal is to create surplus electricity so that we can use THAT to crack hydrogen as a liquid fuel.  We convert to CNG for transportation then disengage completely from the middle east.  We are only THERE for the oil in the first place.  Getting out of the ME means we can close costly bases, not have to fight ridiculously costly wars, devote ridiculous percentages of nondiscretionary spending to ""defense,"" and not have to worry much about terrorism.  Nobody attacks freaking Brazil because they do not have military bases all over the world.  For those who think this isn't a big deal, imagine what it would be like to have a Chinese base in your city with Chinese military personnel walking around effectively above the law and literally occupying your country.  We've never been invaded nor occupied so most Americans do not get this particular aspect of the US's imperial posture.At the point we realize these goals, we become a net energy EXPORTER and stop importing 14mbpd of oil per year, DRAMATICALLY improving our current account imbalance.  Collaterally the government invests $10B here and there in competitive races and contests where the winner gets the cash, for alternative propulsion technologies such as Quasiturbines, alcohol or gasoline fuel cells, H2 fuel cells, next-gen batteries, compressed air cars, as well as for diamond semiconductors to shrink the Moore's Law doubling interval.  We desperately need more computer power to either solve fusion or else develop the type of stuff like carbon nanotubes that we could string a wire into space with and mine the solar winds for power.The military and space programs could serve this purpose by developing ridiculously high-tech useless weapons like carbon nanotube tanks or planes that we'd need not to attack anyone with, merely to develop the technology which would then be partnered to GM to build carbonfiber car parts that we could EXPORT.  This keeps the defense industry happy, the environuts happy, the peaceniks and warniks happy...basically everyone is happy just like my avatar.If you manage to read all the way through this diatribe I'm writing you see continual reference to INVESTMENTS.  At the point the USA became a net exporter because we had THE best car parts, THE best batteries, excess H2, etc., we would have little to NO problems with debt, jobs, or the trade imbalance.  We'd be like we WERE before we became a ponzi hedge fund producing PAPER.Instead we focused ourselves on bailing out our PARASITE, the financial system.

During clearly deflationary trends, it received substantial tailwinds from the panic trade.  During an inflationary trend, it receives monetary tailwinds.Oil is another example of a paradox.  Global demand is down significantly, which is good, because crude & condensate production peaked in 2005 and aggregate liquids in 2008.  But there is the price sitting at near $50 instead of $20s or so where it had resided in past deflationary episodes.FYI gold production has also peaked.  Obviously, as this is not a consumable and has limited industrial utility there is no true ""scarcity"" play on it, but given contracting production, simple static marginal demand would be sufficient to maintain pricing strength.

The AIG situation was elucidated by one of his gold members prior to his first ticker on it.In essence, there are several factors in play.  One is that AIG is big in China and has substantial assets outside the AIGFP division.The second, and unknown to most people, is that CDS counterparty claims are not - repeat NOT - stayed by a BK filing.  This entitles CDS counterparties to move to seize assets of their CDS surety.  What this means is that Goldman et al could have and would have moved to seize cash assets of AIG, including a ton of Chinese cash policies, annuities, life insurance, and a whole host of money-good assets all over the world.This is the situation that ""needed"" to be prevented via the conduit to the banks, many of whom were not US-based.  Had they not made the AIG's CDS counterparties whole, there would have been absolute mayhem as capital controls were thrown up all over the globe to prevent GS and the rest of the banks from directly seizing whatever AIG assets they could get their hands on, with immediate divestiture of JQPs all over the world, many of whom lived in creditor nations.  The internationalization of finance makes situations like this inevitable.  It's also why the Fed has been far more active in the Agency repurchase market than in Treasuries and why net foreign holdings of Agencies fell of a freaking CLIFF when FNM and FRE went down.  Our creditors no longer want any form of our debt other than Treasuries, and soon probably not those either.AIG served as the biggest idiot in the room.  I've got no fucking clue what Cassano was thinking other than he wasn't.  The way the CDS market works is NOT for insurance purposes.  It serves as a credit growth mechanism via origination of CDSs as synthetic debt then the securitization thereof into synthetic CDOs.  If you peruse recent financial writing on the PPIP, you will see reference to synthetic CDOs on the books of the banks.  These contain CDS payment streams.  The synthetic debt market, as evinced by the sheer notional volume of CDS claims worldwide eventually DWARFED the reality-based credit markets and by orders of magnitude.This system worked out without loss exposure to the originators because they were able to net out the CDSs that they wrote.  AIG apparently ended up being the repository everyone used to net; there was evidently no CDS contract they would not write and hold.  Truly idiotic in that they did not grasp what was going on in securitization for the latter stages of the credit bubble cycle and that they did not seek to net their own exposure out.  AIG was the easy whore that everyone knows to buy a few drinks and bang.So when the inevitable defaults cascaded, all roads eventually led back to AIG as the ultimate bagholder.  And we know that led directly to our wallets.",,,Sir Mole III,2,?

They are a politically-run money funnel to Wall Street.This is the consequence of letting the government anywhere near the business of finance (where they've been for 20 years).AIG is a catastrophe, it was the dumping ground for all the synthetic debt originators that needed to net out the CDSs they initiated.",,,Fishrman,1,?
822,evilspeculator,Wednesday Wrap Up,[],88 comments,http://evilspeculator.com/wednesday-wrap-up-4/,disrespekt,"Bear in mind that this is the paper that the PPIP is going to end up buying.  The Fed will lend $.86 to buy this shit at mark, which is near fucking par, and the banks will probably borrow the .07 of their investment to match with the .07 from the Treasury and then put that into a SIV and buy their own assets with it.The shit gets written off as a total loss or 75% loss in the case of the best-quality ABX paper, and the banks keep the .93.  Massive profits, massive bonuses for ""performance.""  The Fed eats the losses which accrue to the taxpayer either via more debt (if we can) or else monetization by the Fed.There is no real alternative other than monetization of all these bad assets but that means the death of the USD as reserve currency which means what we delusionally thought of as our cherished ""way of life"" comes to an end rather abruptly.  Like Iceland abruptly",,,TomOfTheNorth,1,?

SPY put in a bullish divergence in oversold RSI on the 5m, a signal I'd normally play long.  The momo has been decisively to the upside.

They ended up developing a chimeric SARS-Cov with human transmissibility by altering its spike proteins.  They used Gain of Function, which is basically superaugmented evolution.  The technique uses animal hosts where you infect, harvest, and reinfect the animal hosts in series in rapid succession.  Effectively this causes an explosion in viral evolution as the normal processes of infection are accelerated greatly, and the virulence is guaranteed because the technique involves using virus from one host to infect subsequent hosts.GoF was \"banned\" by NIH because in 2012 a team used it to create a H5N1 variant that targeted ACE2, prompting a multiyear debate on whether or not this was something that should be done as that virus has a mortality of 60% and would literally have wiped out half of the planet if it were to escape from a lab.

The other Wuhan lab coauthor is coincidentally the scientist who first isolated a SARS-like coronavirus that had ACE2 intermediation, in 2013 (published).WIV seemed to be coronavirus central; like this virus was their central focus and Zhi had a very prominent role there.  The odds that of all places in the world, a SARS comes out with spike protein variation (this is HOW it differs from existing Covs) right there of all places preponderates heavily just based on circumstantial evidence that this was a lab leak.This is like having Jack the Ripper staying in a hotel and you find a body in the morning with knife wounds in a hotel stairwell.  An investigative team looking for a probable cause would examine things just like this- who was a potential perpetrator who was nearby at the time.The whitewashing of this, or else utter ignorance of GoF and how it *does not mean* \"genetically engineered,\" is bordering on criminal and has been aided and abetted by Nature, which is or was a flagship scientific journal.EVERY time some supposed expert on virology says \"there is no evidence\" for a lab leak, remember this- there is presently NO EVIDENCE for a zoonotic origin either!

The only issue was the keystone effect of its tiny nexus to the real world, the default triggers.  Those were back on defaults of real mortgages.

That\\'s what happens when you have synthetic debt, there\\'s no real capital.To provide some definitional context, a CDS is like a bond in reverse, except with no capital.  It has a coupon payment that can be tranched.  AIG served as the ultimate idiot in the room, the final link in the daisy chain against whom everyone netted out.  So, basically the whole street all these years was getting paid to originate CDSs, take the payment streams therefrom, tranche them into CDOs, sell them off, extract fees, then find a counterparty to net the original exposure out to.  This is criminal.There was no insurable interest, needed to be no interest whatsoever on the part of the CDS writer.  An IB could write a CDS on my mortgage without even knowing who I am and then tranche its coupon and make money off this nonsense!These CDSs have been netting at .05-.07 in the few BKs we\\'ve had...that is a TON of \"latent\" or \"theoretical\" inverse bond capital that was not paid, destroying the leverage inherent in the instruments, and causing the deflation.', 'see more', 'ViewView in discussion', 'disrespekt', 'Anna Mall', '11 years ago', \"This is a common misconception.The way to avoid the housing crisis was not to run a debt-based monetary ponzi.

It\\'s impossible for them to.  Look at the wikipedia ranking of per capita oil consumption by nation and see what type of supply rate we would require for this even to be feasible.  It\\'s astoundingly beyond what the earth can produce.  We consume more than 30x what Indians consume and more than 10x what the Chinese do, per capita.  We consume 18mbpd, against a population of 300M...correct my math but Indian and Chinese consumption parity would alone require an additional 160mbpd of oil production.

Those who can\\'t grasp that we have entered a new Age here are going to be in some trouble.One of the things I have tried to get people to understand here and on TF is that energy is a fundamental input to all economic activity.  We grew and grew until our ability to supply energy hit a ceiling in 2006, because all that growth was underpinned by steadily rising supplies of energy.Supposing we conduct a thought experiment of this 5-7% growth in asia...what are the more cars going to run on?  What will power more buildings?  What will power more factories making more things?  What will power more cranes to erect more structures?  What will melt more steel and fabricate more iPods and weld more cars?That is the fundamental problem here and why the market crashed when it did.  Energy is in a state of transition from an increasingly abundant commodity to an increasingly scarce one.  Sure, we can say oh we\\'ll build nuclear plants.  Setting aside the EROI on those, what happens when we achieve peak Uranium?  Nobody who looks into the energy situation in any depth is not very frightened because the needed scale of construction of alternative power is staggeringly vast.  As oil production declines inexorably and irreversibly, remember we will not only need to replace lost BTUs but also to add more on top of that in order to achieve supply growth necessary for economic growth.  Take a look at France\\'s energy situation...they are at nuclear saturation; research why their heat wave a few years back killed 3000 people, why they had to shut plants off, why they cannot build more plants.  Functionally, when we pass peak, we must effectively *double* our energy supply growth rate, first to make up for lost oil, second to supply growth needs.  This is physically impossible.

Instead of fractional lending that creates inflation and deflation bubbles, money should be printed in line with real production such that its value remains constant.

No money exists in our system absent what is lent by a bank.  The overhang of the compounding interest exponential function forces exponential economic growth in order to maintain the system, otherwise interest begins to consume a larger and larger share of real production and the only way to pay interest is to create ever more production.It should be obvious that no system with finite constraints can grow forever.

This maximizes the NPV of the well trading it for lifespan.Cantarell is a good example of this, as is the N Slope.  The BPT trust 10k forecast 7-9% YoY production declines...reality was 15+%.

Let the Fed eat it.Basically, money is not printed, it is lent into existence, at interest.  That places a concurrent demand on the economy to generate the output needed to pay back the principal (zero-growth state) along with a need to grow in order that the interest can be repaid.  Money denominates real things, and the compound interest component mandates growth in output, production, more things so that the interest can be repaid.  This is all well and good so long as the economy continues to grow.  However, when we achieved the peak supply condition in oil, it became clear to those who can use logic along with basic math that the economy\\'s ability to continue to grow had stopped.  This is when you see deleveraging and the mass stampede out of debt.  The music simply stopped.If you distill our economy solely down to energy for transportation, a peak oil condition means that there will not be more consumption of oil next year because there won\\'t be more oil supplied next year.  So, more drivers driving more miles in more cars (growth = more) will not be feasible.  The absolute real transactional volume of that economy peaks along with its energy inputs.Those who have debt and see that they CANNOT grow to meet their forward obligations have no choice but to deleverage, and if necessary, liquidate.The real economy peaked several years ago.  What we had was a synthetic economy based upon CDS-derived CDOs.  Notional GDP continued to grow as each transaction in synthetic debt represented nominal wealth creation.  But, it was fictional.  As the real economy peaked, its nexus to the synthetic economy began to cause cascading collapse in a system that required growth, that being the monetary system itself.  They had NO CHOICE but to do these apparently \"stupid\" things because there was NO option within the real economy past 2005 to generate real growth.  So, they moved money around in synthetic instruments and this notional transactional \"GDP\" was what serviced the growth needs of the monetary base.The Fed has no choice now but to print money because the real economy cannot service the interest levied upon it by the monetary system itself.  The debts CANNOT be repaid.  People do not know this, but our monetary system effectively collapsed in August 2007.  It had been Wile E.

Labor banded together and formed its OWN corporation, and demanded concessions.It is no accident that CEOs through the heyday of labor unions were generally very REASONABLY paid and that corporations that paid dividends had to use free cash for THAT instead of stock buybacks to keep the options grants from diluting the common.

And, when that produces a short-term profit, to bonus themselves every single dollar of it.You are not going to get rich being a shareholder of this operation because they don\\'t pay dividends; they pay themselves.  The UAW and its membership, corrupt as it is, are NOT the reason GM or Chrysler went BK - management is.  The same management that sits on the boards of all the financials and other companies and rubber stamps CEO corruption.  You see this played out in the outrage by AIG execs of all people, a BEYOND BK company, at the notion that they shouldn\\'t receive 7 figure salaries working for a company that loses tens of billions per quarter.The US middle class is collapsing because of loss of labor pricing power and an entrenched executive class that functions on backscratching and nepotism.  You can\\'t get ahead in Brazil or Mexico or China unless you were born into the right womb, and that dynastic wealth has one goal, to preserve itself.  Right now, the very rich are seeing NO hard times.  Where are the paycuts for bankers?  They fire all the rank-and-file and pay themselves retention bonuses to do it.  We live in a corruptocracy that very strongly reminds me of the situation in Brazil, for example.  There are two classes, rich and everybody else, and a sliver-thin group of people who are being dragged slighly upward by the global debt bubble.  That is where we are going.  The rich OWN the government.  The bigger it gets, the more money there is to divide amongst the lobbyists, the Congress, and the businesses that profit from policy.  Wonder why there are paid advertising spots now for national health care?  Think it\\'s because someone cares JUST THAT MUCH?  Think again.  Somebody stands to profit.We should outsource executive jobs to lower cost Chinese and Indian incompetents.  They could BK any of these companies FAR more cheaply than our domestic executives.And, one theme that is popular on KD\\'s website is that people have some moral obligation to repay debts.  No.  I have a moral obligation to repay a person, not a corporation, and certainly not a BANK, who NEVER actually had the money they lent me in the first place.  If I borrow from the Count, I should pay the Count back.  A bank?  Hell, they INVENTED the capital, lending, at fractional reserve, money they never even had!  What RIGHT do they have to TAKE my real property on account of interest levied on fictional money?  The banks have the privilege of earning interest on \"capital\" they never possessed.  A debt to a bank is a business transaction, not personal.  The fractional reserve system creates inflation by its very nature, and the banks and bankers get access to that money before it has diluted the monetary base stock.  They get inflation dollars at today\\'s prices...we get them as they dilute.  And, then the bankers preserve their purchasing power by levying interest on this conjured money at rates beyond inflation.  And, they have the courts to help them seize REAL THINGS if this fictional capital is not repaid.The whole system is a fucking scam and needs to be torn down.

Essentially, C&C peaked in 2005, but there were sufficient increases in biofues, NGL, and unconventionals, to make a higher total liquids peak in 2008 despite a decrease in C&C production.The problem with other liquids besides NGL is that they are of ridiculously lower EROI than C&C.  Original oil production had a 100:1 energy positivity ratio; we are now down to 3:1 and dropping.  Tarsands require massive consumption of energy to heat water to mobilize the bitumen.  So much so that Alberta was or is going to construct a nuclear plant to do it; right now they are burning tons of natural gas.  This swaps one form of energy for another, albeit at a positive EROI.The oil situation is not a matter of running out, it is a matter of diminishing return on investment.  When I explain peak to people, I try saying things like supply inflection or supply cannot increase, flow rate maximum...most don't get it.  EROI is a bit easier to explain; it's like an apple tree.  You go after the low-hanging fruit first; it has the highest energy positivity, because you don't have to climb for it.  The higher fruit you have to expend energy to go up and get, and so your return on energy invested gets lower.  And, oil wells, unlike apples, don't replace themselves in a year.  At some point, the energy from an apple equals the energy needed to climb to get it.  At this point, you are at breakeven and the rest of the tree higher up is inaccessible.  Even if it has infinity apples higher up it takes more energy to get them than you get back.  This is why things like theoretical reserves in shit like oil shale or other low-EROI sources, including tarsands are grossly misleading.The oil situation is about rate of supply, not reserves.  Canada ostensibly has 250B bbl in tarsands, equivalent to the reserves in Saudi Arabia.  The difference is that that 250B worth of bitumen will only flow, at best, 4-5mbpd and this means consumption of massive amounts of NG, a nuclear plant, and the pollution of nearly every fresh water source west of the rockies.  KSA on the other hand, flows 10-12mbpd from conventional sources.  This is a clear indication of diminishing EROI and why those who claim that there is a trillion bbl in shale are fools.  So what if there is?  Let's just make it a quadrillion barrels...so what?  We cannot get at them at a rate sufficient to support the rate at which we desire to consume them.  Peak oil is about rates, not reserves.\", 'see more', 'ViewView in discussion', 'disrespekt', 'lilme', '11 years ago', 'There are immense structural differences between 1930 and now.The single BIGGEST factor is the achievement of Peak Oil in 2005, then Peak Liquids in 2008.There is simply a hard ceiling on industrial output now that DID NOT exist in 1930.  Nevermind the entitlements obligations and all the rest of it; it is not possible to GROW out of this debt without massive increases in energy consumption and supply.The global recession will be sustained.  Watch the oil price.  If we see a fiscal policy-led rebound here we will see a concurrent increase in oil consumption which will AGAIN ram us into the supply constraint and oil will again spike to $150 as demand exceeds production and inventories are again drawn down to meet the deficit.  We will repeat this collapse cycle.  That is your Wave C of 4 down and it is inevitable.I cannot fathom that people can believe that exponential growth can simply meet a speedbump and then there just \"will be\" a recovery because of interest rate policies and increased debt.This is not 1930.  It is not 1973, it is not 1982.  How economists and cental bankers can fail to realize what the NECESSARY inputs are for economic activity and that the most critical input has reached supply rate inflection is beyond me.

I wonder, then, if what is occuring is that quants or program trades are shorting 2x and 3x inverse ETFs, primarily the major 2x inverses and the arb needs of the trade balance is causing the ballistic spike we've seen in names which are quite literally at the verge of bankruptcy.Add onto this that for every ISEE put opened on an index, the MM will typically establish a short position in that stock as a hedge for the trade.  If you buy puts on SRS, your MM should short the underlier to net his position, and this would seem to have a 2x effect on anything in the index, as far as Profunds having to set up some kind of double-long synthetic position.  Crammer has long maintained that SKF wags the financials sphere via its size and leverage.  I wonder if the unusual convergence of margin quant trading and the evaporation of liquidity and short availability of a lot of the indices implies that the very same thing is occurring now except in reverse.  The big players are using puts and inverse ETFs as well as margin buying on the underliers to drive literally the crappiest stocks to the moon.I cannot prove that this is what is happening; all I have is a theory that tends to fit the facts.

One is that AIG is big in China and has substantial assets outside the AIGFP division.The second, and unknown to most people, is that CDS counterparty claims are not - repeat NOT - stayed by a BK filing.  This entitles CDS counterparties to move to seize assets of their CDS surety.  What this means is that Goldman et al could have and would have moved to seize cash assets of AIG, including a ton of Chinese cash policies, annuities, life insurance, and a whole host of money-good assets all over the world.This is the situation that \"needed\" to be prevented via the conduit to the banks, many of whom were not US-based.  Had they not made the AIG\\'s CDS counterparties whole, there would have been absolute mayhem as capital controls were thrown up all over the globe to prevent GS and the rest of the banks from directly seizing whatever AIG assets they could get their hands on, with immediate divestiture of JQPs all over the world, many of whom lived in creditor nations.

I\\'ve got no fucking clue what Cassano was thinking other than he wasn\\'t.  The way the CDS market works is NOT for insurance purposes.  It serves as a credit growth mechanism via origination of CDSs as synthetic debt then the securitization thereof into synthetic CDOs.  If you peruse recent financial writing on the PPIP, you will see reference to synthetic CDOs on the books of the banks.  These contain CDS payment streams.  The synthetic debt market, as evinced by the sheer notional volume of CDS claims worldwide eventually DWARFED the reality-based credit markets and by orders of magnitude.This system worked out without loss exposure to the originators because they were able to net out the CDSs that they wrote.  AIG apparently ended up being the repository everyone used to net; there was evidently no CDS contract they would not write and hold.  Truly idiotic in that they did not grasp what was going on in securitization for the latter stages of the credit bubble cycle and that they did not seek to net their own exposure out.
